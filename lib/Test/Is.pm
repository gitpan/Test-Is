=head1 NAME

Test::Is - Skip test in a declarative way, following the Lancaster Consensus

=head1 VERSION

version 20140823

=head1 SYNOPSIS

I want that this runs only on interactive environments:

    use Test::Is 'interactive';

This test is an extended test: it takes much time to run or may have special
running conditions that may inconvenience a user that just want to install the
module:

    use Test::Is 'extended';

Both:

    use Test::Is 'interactive', 'extended';

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module is a simple way of following the
L<specifications of the environment|https://github.com/Perl-Toolchain-Gang/toolchain-site/blob/master/lancaster-consensus.md#environment-variables-for-testing-contexts>
variables available for Perl tests as defined as one of the
"L<Lancaster Consensus|https://github.com/Perl-Toolchain-Gang/toolchain-site/blob/master/lancaster-consensus.md>"
at Perl QA Hackathon 2013. Those variables
(C<NONINTERACTIVE_TESTING>, C<EXTENDED_TESTING>) define which tests should be
skipped.

If the environment does not match what the author of the test expected, the
complete test is skipped (in the same way as C<use L<Test::More> skip_all =E<gt>
...>).

As an author, you can also expect that you will automatically benefit of later
evolutions of this specification just by upgrading the module.

As a CPAN toolchain author (CPAN client, smoker...) you may want to ensure at
runtime that the installed version of this module matches the environment
you set yourself.
